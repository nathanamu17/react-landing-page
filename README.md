# React Landing Page with Form Validation and Success Modal

This project is a simple React landing page that includes form validation and displays a success modal upon form submission. It was built using **Create React App** and includes a responsive layout for both desktop and mobile views.

## Features
- Responsive landing page with a modern design
- Form validation to ensure correct email format before submission
- Success modal displayed after the form is successfully submitted

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nathanamu17/react-landing-page.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd react-landing-page
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

#### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
For more information, see the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

#### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed.

For more information on deployment, visit [deployment guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

#### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all the configuration files and dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project. You can then modify them to suit your needs. However, once you eject, you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject` unless you need to customize your configuration. The curated feature set is suitable for most use cases.
